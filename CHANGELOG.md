# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.1] - 2025-06-26

### Fixed
- **Table parser empty cell handling** - Fixed incorrect "column count mismatch" errors when tables have empty trailing cells. Parser now properly pads missing trailing cells with empty strings and converts empty cells to null values, resolving false validation errors.

### Added
- **Freeform example with Load button** - Added comprehensive product catalog example showcasing freeform data format with "Load Freeform Example" button alongside existing "Load Tabular Example" button in both test interfaces
- **Improved example organization** - Grouped related fields on same lines in freeform examples (stock status + quantity, weight + dimensions) for better readability and demonstration of multi-field line syntax

### Changed
- **Project organization improvements** - Moved debug, example, and test files to organized subdirectories (`debug/`, `examples/`, `test/`) for cleaner root directory structure
- **Updated import paths** - Fixed all script and import references to use correct `../dist/` paths after file reorganization
- **Enhanced test interface** - Updated both test.html and test-umd.html with dual example buttons and improved organization

### Technical
- **Import path consistency** - Ensured all moved files reference correct relative paths to dist folder
- **Development workflow** - Updated serve.py to work correctly with new directory structure
- **File organization** - Maintained functionality while improving project structure and discoverability

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-25

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **Removed data validation beyond basic type checking** - This library now focuses purely on parsing structure and converting types. All business rule validation has been removed to maintain clear separation of concerns. Applications should implement their own validation logic or use a separate validation library.

### Added
- **Comprehensive developer documentation**
  - Complete extension development guide (`docs/DEVELOPERS.md`)
  - Full API reference documentation (`docs/API.md`)
  - System architecture overview (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)
  - Contribution guidelines (`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`)
  - Extension examples for custom parsers and formatters
- **Improved project organization**
  - Reorganized validation modules into dedicated `src/validation/` folder
  - Moved data parser to `src/parsers/data.ts` for consistency
  - Created organized directory structure: `debug/`, `examples/`, `test/`
  - Updated development server to work with new file organization

### Removed
- **ValidationRules interface** - No longer needed as validation is left to consuming applications
- **Business rule validation methods** - Removed from all parser and validator classes
- **Validation documentation and examples** - Custom validator examples and documentation removed
- **parseValidationRules utility function** - No longer needed without validation rules

### Changed
- **Parser scope clarification** - Library now explicitly focused on parsing and type conversion only
- **Validation methods simplified** - Only basic type checking remains for parsing purposes
- **Documentation updated** - All references to data validation removed, focus on parsing capabilities
- **Project structure** - Root directory cleaned up with files moved to appropriate subdirectories

### Fixed
- **Import path consistency** - Updated relative imports after file reorganization
- **Development workflow** - Updated serve.py and README references for new file locations
- **Build process** - Ensured all changes pass linting and type checking

## [0.1.2] - 2025-06-24

### Added

### Fixed
